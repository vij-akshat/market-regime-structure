# Market Regime Detection using Hidden Markov Models

This project implements statistical regime detection to identify latent market states such as high-volatility and low-volatility regimes. Using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), the notebook estimates probabilistic regime transitions and state-dependent return distributions.
Regime detection is foundational for volatility timing, risk management, and dynamic allocation strategies.

## What It Does
Given:
- Historical return series
- Volatility clustering structure

The model assumes:
- Returns are generated by hidden states
- Returns are generated by hidden states
- Each state has its own mean and variance
- States evolve via a Markov transition matrix
Formally:
$$
P(S_{t} = j | S_{t-1} = i) = P_{ij}
$$
Returns follow:
$$
r_{t} \sim $$

The notebook:
- Fits a 2-state Gaussian HMM
- Estimates transition probabilities
- Classifies regime probabilities over time
- Visualizes regime overlays on price data

## Features
- Implements Gaussian Hidden Markov Model
- Identifies volatility clustering
- Estimates transition matrix
- Produces filtered regime probabilities
- Visualizes regime shifts over time
---
## Visualization
- Time-series with regime coloring
- State probability plots
- Transition matrix heatmap
- Volatility comparison by regime
---
## Why It Matters
Markets are not i.i.d.
Regime shifts drive:
- Volatility clustering
- Drawdowns
- Strategy breakdowns

Understanding latent states is critical for:
- Risk control
- Volatility targeting
- Dynamic leverage
- Macro allocation frameworks
